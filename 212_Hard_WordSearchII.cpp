    1. Take all words and push it into trie
    2. start bfs from all the nodes and check does we have any word
       available in trie DS?
    3. If you found any word completion that means you found one item of your
       answer
    4. One more optimization you can do here, you only need to start the finding word 
       whose first character start from the first character of word.
