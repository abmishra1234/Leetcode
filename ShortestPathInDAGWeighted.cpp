/*
	Pre-Condition here is
	1. Directed and Acyclic Graph
	2. you will be looking for shortest path from one src to n-1 destibnation vertex

	If the above pre - condition met in your problem than you are good to go for the 
	below type of solution approach

	Approach:
	As you know, in graph, there are two different traversing algorithm available

	BFS : using queue data structure
	DFS : using system stack or custom stack

	Usually, when you have large recursion depth possible, in that scenario
	might be BFS is better solution instead DFS but in general theoritically 
	BFS and DFS both will work in all the scenario with miner customisation
	in all graph problem.
