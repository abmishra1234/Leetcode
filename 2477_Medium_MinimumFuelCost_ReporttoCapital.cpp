	Development Approach for All Senior Engineer' - TDD
	07 Principled thumb rule for cracking the coding interview

	1. Get the unserstanding of problem first.

	2. Analyze the Constraint and do check is their any
	problem in your approach with this constraint ?

	3. Prepare your solution glue code means , how to verify your implementation ?
		- Infra of your code
		- Test cases required to verify
		  your code implementation

	4. complete your implemenation and also dry run
	   your code for all the test cases prepared earlier??

	5. Share your limitation of your implementation upfront to your
	   evaluator incase human or otherwise put the validation check
	   in your implemenation.

	6. If everything worrking fine for you, just submit your
	   code to evaluation portal or your interviewer

	7. MOST IMP THUMB RULE, don't stop talking, between your discussion
	   otherwise that silence is creating lots of confusion.
	   Incase you are unable to write the code while speaking than that would 
	   be share to interviewer first.
