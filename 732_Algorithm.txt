        Algorithm:
        1. Let's check the overlapping case with existing
           schedule

        2. a. NO OVERLAP ??
        you need to add new interval 
        in
        - interval array
        - you need to insert interval 
        into s1
        - you need to insert interval 
        into s2

        2. b. OVERLAP ??
        
        YES, than call one utility 
        method for overlap, which 
        will handle
        following all overlap cases 
        as explained

        If required, s1 and s2 will 
        be also updated and interval 
        array also need to 
        be updated.
        
        3. Fetch the highest 
        frequency interval from 
        s2 and returned the frequency 
        as output
        of book api call..
