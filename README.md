# Leetcode

Practicing the Leetcode problem for making ourself ready to market. Why?
Because i Feel that coding is the only task which needs more logical thinking and their job is more relevant in mass with Software Industry.

What is this?
THis is with understranding that going forward we may have lots of Automation to be kicked off and it
will handle lots of today's mundane tasks from human.


How to make yourself more relevant with the current time?
I believe thay until the point you are making your self part of the Core learning team, you will be Ok.

If your job is only to make other's relevant than you are sitting on Edge where you will see pain very soon.



Thank You
